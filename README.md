Lockzilla is a sophisticated and secure password manager designed to help users efficiently store, manage, and protect their passwords. 
In today’s digital age, maintaining strong and unique passwords for multiple online accounts is crucial for cybersecurity. 
However, many users struggle with remembering complex passwords, which often leads to poor password practices. 
Existing password managers can sometimes lack comprehensive security features or fail to offer an intuitive user experience. 
Lockzilla addresses these challenges by providing a robust, user-friendly solution that allows users to easily add, update, and delete passwords, while ensuring their security through advanced encryption and management features.

Lockzilla’s key functionalities include the ability to securely add, update, and delete passwords for various accounts.
With a simple and intuitive interface, users can quickly store their credentials while ensuring that sensitive information is encrypted. 
The platform is designed to support multiple users, making it ideal for teams or families who need to share passwords securely. 
The backend of Lockzilla is powered by Flask, a lightweight web framework that handles user authentication, session management, and secure interactions. 
SQLAlchemy is used to manage the SQLite3 database, storing user information, encrypted passwords, and other necessary data efficiently.

To further enhance security, Lockzilla leverages Werkzeug, a security library for Flask, to safeguard user data with various cryptographic techniques. 
Password health checks are integrated into the system using the “pwned” - API, providing users with insights into the strength of their passwords and recommending improvements where necessary. 
Additionally, Lockzilla features a password generator tool that creates strong, random passwords, reducing the risk of weak or reused passwords. 
The platform uses SHA encryption to protect all sensitive information, ensuring that passwords are never stored in plaintext. 
Users can also take advantage of the "copy to clipboard" functionality, making it easy to transfer passwords securely without exposing them to unauthorized parties.

With Lockzilla, users can enjoy the convenience of managing their passwords securely and effortlessly, with peace of mind knowing that their sensitive information is protected by industry-standard security measures. 

Whether you're a single user or part of a team, Lockzilla offers a personalized, scalable solution to meet your password management needs.
